Talk to Kotaro was created during the height of the COVID-\/19 pandemic, when performing Human-\/robot interaction (HRI) experiments in person became nearly impossible. Like everything else, HRI research had to go online. Many distinct research groups were developing their own solutions, but very few of these were made available for the HRI community. Thus, came the idea of making Talk to Kotaro open-\/source.
